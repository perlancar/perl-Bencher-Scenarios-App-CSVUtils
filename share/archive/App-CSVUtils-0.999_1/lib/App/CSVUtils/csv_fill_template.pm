Templates are text that contain `[[NAME]]` field placeholders. The field
placeholders will be replaced by values from the CSV file. This is a simple
alternative to mail-merge. (I first wrote this utility because LibreOffice
Writer, as always, has all the annoying bugs; that particular time, one that
prevented mail merge from working.)

Example:

    % cat madlib.txt
    Today I went to the park. I saw a(n) [[adjective1]] [[noun1]] running
    towards me. It looked hungry, really hungry. Horrified and terrified, I took
    a(n) [[adjective2]] [[noun2]] and waved the thing [[adverb1]] towards it.
    [[adverb2]], when it arrived at my feet, it [[verb1]] and [[verb2]] me
    instead. I was relieved, the [[noun1]] was a friendly creature after all.
    After we [[verb3]] for a little while, I went home with a(n) [[noun3]] on my
    face. That was an unforgettable day indeed.

App::CSVUtils::csv_fill_template - Substitute template values in a text file with fields from CSV rows

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.999_1 of App::CSVUtils::csv_fill_template (from Perl distribution App-CSVUtils), released on 2022-12-21.

=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 csv_fill_template

Usage:

 csv_fill_template(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

Substitute template values in a text file with fields from CSV rows.

Templates are text that contain C<[[NAME]]> field placeholders. The field
placeholders will be replaced by values from the CSV file. This is a simple
alternative to mail-merge. (I first wrote this utility because LibreOffice
Writer, as always, has all the annoying bugs; that particular time, one that
prevented mail merge from working.)

Example:

 % cat madlib.txt
 Today I went to the park. I saw a(n) [[adjective1]] [[noun1]] running
 towards me. It looked hungry, really hungry. Horrified and terrified, I took
 a(n) [[adjective2]] [[noun2]] and waved the thing [[adverb1]] towards it.
 [[adverb2]], when it arrived at my feet, it [[verb1]] and [[verb2]] me
 instead. I was relieved, the [[noun1]] was a friendly creature after all.
 After we [[verb3]] for a little while, I went home with a(n) [[noun3]] on my
 face. That was an unforgettable day indeed.

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<input_escape_char> => I<str>

Specify character to escape value in field in input CSV, will be passed to Text::CSV_XS.

Defaults to C<\\> (backslash). Overrides C<--input-tsv> option.

=item * B<input_filename> => I<filename> (default: "-")

Input CSV file.

Use C<-> to read from stdin.

Encoding of input file is assumed to be UTF-8.

=item * B<input_header> => I<bool> (default: 1)

Specify whether input CSV has a header row.

By default, the first row of the input CSV will be assumed to contain field
names (and the second row contains the first data row). When you declare that
input CSV does not have header row (C<--no-input-header>), the first row of the
CSV is assumed to contain the first data row. Fields will be named C<field1>,
C<field2>, and so on.

=item * B<input_quote_char> => I<str>

Specify field quote character in input CSV, will be passed to Text::CSV_XS.

Defaults to C<"> (double quote). Overrides C<--input-tsv> option.

=item * B<input_sep_char> => I<str>

Specify field separator character in input CSV, will be passed to Text::CSV_XS.

Defaults to C<,> (comma). Overrides C<--input-tsv> option.

=item * B<input_tsv> => I<true>

Inform that input file is in TSV (tab-separated) format instead of CSV.

Overriden by C<--input-sep-char>, C<--input-quote-char>, C<--input-escape-char>
options. If one of those options is specified, then C<--input-tsv> will be
ignored.

=item * B<template_filename>* => I<filename>

(No description)


=back

Returns an enveloped result (an array).

First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status code
(200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element
($reason) is a string containing error message, or something like "OK" if status is
200. Third element ($payload) is the actual result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth
element (%result_meta) is called result metadata and is optional, a hash
that contains extra information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional metadata.

Return value:  (any)
