=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.999_1 of csv-fill-template (from Perl distribution App-CSVUtils), released on 2022-12-21.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<csv-fill-template> B<L<--help|/"--help, -h, -?">> (or B<L<-h|/"--help, -h, -?">>, B<L<-?|/"--help, -h, -?">>)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Templates are text that contain C<[[NAME]]> field placeholders. The field
placeholders will be replaced by values from the CSV file. This is a simple
alternative to mail-merge. (I first wrote this utility because LibreOffice
Writer, as always, has all the annoying bugs; that particular time, one that
prevented mail merge from working.)

Example:

 % cat madlib.txt
 Today I went to the park. I saw a(n) [[adjective1]] [[noun1]] running
 towards me. It looked hungry, really hungry. Horrified and terrified, I took
 a(n) [[adjective2]] [[noun2]] and waved the thing [[adverb1]] towards it.
 [[adverb2]], when it arrived at my feet, it [[verb1]] and [[verb2]] me
 instead. I was relieved, the [[noun1]] was a friendly creature after all.
 After we [[verb3]] for a little while, I went home with a(n) [[noun3]] on my
 face. That was an unforgettable day indeed.
 
 % cat values.csv

 % csv-fill-template values.csv madlib.txt
 Today I went to the park. I saw a(n) slow six-wheeler truck running
 towards me. It looked hungry, really hungry. Horrified and terrified, I took
 a(n) gigantic lollipop and waved the thing angrily towards it.
 hesitantly, when it arrived at my feet, it threw and kissed me
 instead. I was relieved, the six-wheeler truck was a friendly creature after all.
 After we stared for a little while, I went home with a(n) piece of tissue on my
 face. That was an unforgettable day indeed.

 Today I went to the park. I saw a(n) sweet pelican running
 towards me. It looked hungry, really hungry. Horrified and terrified, I took
 a(n) delicious bottle of parfume and waved the thing confidently towards it.
 passively, when it arrived at my feet, it exercised and jumped me
 instead. I was relieved, the pelican was a friendly creature after all.
 After we slept for a little while, I went home with a(n) desk on my
 face. That was an unforgettable day indeed.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Main options

=over

=item B<--template-filename>=I<s>*

(No description)


Can also be specified as the 2nd command-line argument.

=back

=head2 Input options

=over

=item B<--input-escape-char>=I<s>

Specify character to escape value in field in input CSV, will be passed to Text::CSV_XS.

Defaults to C<\\> (backslash). Overrides C<--input-tsv> option.


=item B<--input-filename>=I<s>

Input CSV file.

Default value:

 "-"

Use C<-> to read from stdin.

Encoding of input file is assumed to be UTF-8.


Can also be specified as the 1st command-line argument.

=item B<--input-quote-char>=I<s>

Specify field quote character in input CSV, will be passed to Text::CSV_XS.

Defaults to C<"> (double quote). Overrides C<--input-tsv> option.


=item B<--input-sep-char>=I<s>

Specify field separator character in input CSV, will be passed to Text::CSV_XS.

Defaults to C<,> (comma). Overrides C<--input-tsv> option.


=item B<--input-tsv>

Inform that input file is in TSV (tab-separated) format instead of CSV.

Overriden by C<--input-sep-char>, C<--input-quote-char>, C<--input-escape-char>
options. If one of those options is specified, then C<--input-tsv> will be
ignored.


=item B<--no-input-header>

Specify that input CSV does not have a header row.

By default, the first row of the input CSV will be assumed to contain field
names (and the second row contains the first data row). When you declare that
input CSV does not have header row (C<--no-input-header>), the first row of the
CSV is assumed to contain the first data row. Fields will be named C<field1>,
C<field2>, and so on.


=back

=head2 Logging options

=over

=item B<--debug>

Shortcut for --log-level=debug.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

By default, these log levels are available (in order of increasing level of
importance, from least important to most): C<trace>, C<debug>, C<info>,
C<warn>/C<warning>, C<error>, C<fatal>. By default, the level is usually set to
C<warn>, which means that log statements with level C<info> and less important
levels will not be shown. To increase verbosity, choose C<info>, C<debug>, or
C<trace>.

For more details on log level and logging, as well as how new logging levels can
be defined or existing ones modified, see L<Log::ger>.


=item B<--quiet>

Shortcut for --log-level=error.

=item B<--trace>

Shortcut for --log-level=trace.

=item B<--verbose>

Shortcut for --log-level=info.

=back

=head2 Output options

=over

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

Default value:

 undef

Output can be displayed in multiple formats, and a suitable default format is
chosen depending on the application and/or whether output destination is
interactive terminal (i.e. whether output is piped). This option specifically
chooses an output format.


=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

Default value:

 0

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

 [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
C<--naked-res> so you just get:

 [1,2,3]


=item B<--page-result>

Filter output through a pager.

This option will pipe the output to a specified pager program. If pager program
is not specified, a suitable default e.g. C<less> is chosen.


=item B<--view-result>

View output using a viewer.

This option will first save the output to a temporary file, then open a viewer
program to view the temporary file. If a viewer program is not chosen, a
suitable default, e.g. the browser, is chosen.


=back

=head2 Other options

=over

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display help message and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Display program's version and exit.

=back

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several
shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C csv-fill-template csv-fill-template

in your bash startup (e.g. F<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install modules using L<cpanm-shcompgen>
which can activate shell completion for scripts immediately.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete csv-fill-template 'p/*/`csv-fill-template`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. F<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then
recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the
line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install L<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install L<shcompgen> as described above.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING


To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull requests on
GitHub.

Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You can
simply modify the code, then test via:

 % prove -l

If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally on your
system), you can install L<Dist::Zilla>,
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>,
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR>, and sometimes one or two other
Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps required beyond
that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
