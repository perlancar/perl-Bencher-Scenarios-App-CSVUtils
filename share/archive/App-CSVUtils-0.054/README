    Usage:

     csv2td(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Return an enveloped aoaos table data from CSV data.

    *Common notes for the utilities*

    Encoding: The utilities in this module/distribution accept and emit UTF8
    text.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   escape_char => *str*

        Specify character to escape value in field in input CSV, will be
        passed to Text::CSV_XS.

        Defaults to "\\" (backslash). Overrides "--tsv" option.

    *   filename* => *filename*

        Input CSV file or URL.

        Use "-" to read from stdin, use "clipboard:" to read from clipboard.

    *   header => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether input CSV has a header row.

        By default ("--header"), the first row of the CSV will be assumed to
        contain field names (and the second row contains the first data
        row). When you declare that CSV does not have header row
        ("--no-header"), the first row of the CSV is assumed to contain the
        first data row. Fields will be named "field1", "field2", and so on.

    *   quote_char => *str*

        Specify field quote character in input CSV, will be passed to
        Text::CSV_XS.

        Defaults to """ (double quote). Overrides "--tsv" option.

    *   sep_char => *str*

        Specify field separator character in input CSV, will be passed to
        Text::CSV_XS.

        Defaults to "," (comma). Overrides "--tsv" option.

    *   tsv => *bool*

        Inform that input file is in TSV (tab-separated) format instead of
        CSV.

        Overriden by "--sep-char", "--quote-char", "--escape-char" options.
        If one of those options is specified, then "--tsv" will be ignored.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  csv2vcf
    Usage:

     csv2vcf(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Create a VCF from selected fields of the CSV.

        row). When you declare that CSV does not have header row
        ("--no-header"), the first row of the CSV is assumed to contain the
        first data row. Fields will be named "field1", "field2", and so on.

    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  csv_add_fields
    Usage:

     csv_add_fields(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Add one or more fields to CSV file.

    Examples:

    *   Add a few new blank fields at the end:

         csv_add_fields(filename => "file.csv", fields => ["field4", "field6", "field5"]);

    *   Add a few new blank fields after a certain field:

         csv_add_fields(
             filename => "file.csv",
           fields   => ["field4", "field6", "field5"],
           after    => "field2"
         );

    *   Add a new field and set its value:

         csv_add_fields(
             filename => "file.csv",
           fields => ["after_tax"],
           eval => "\$main::row->[5] * 1.11"
         );

    *   Add a couple new fields and set their values:

         csv_add_fields(
             filename => "file.csv",
           fields => ["tax_rate", "after_tax"],
           eval => "(0.11, \$main::row->[5] * 1.11)"
         );

    The new fields by default will be added at the end, unless you specify
    one of "--after" (to put after a certain field), "--before" (to put
    before a certain field), or "--at" (to put at specific position, 1 means
    the first field). The new fields will be clustered together though, you
    currently cannot set the position of each new field. But you can later
    reorder fields using csv-sort-fields.

    If supplied, your Perl code ("-e") will be called for each row
    (excluding the header row) and should return the value for the new
    fields (either as a list or as an arrayref). $_ contains the current row
    (as arrayref, or if you specify "-H", as a hashref). $main::row is
    available and contains the current row (always as an arrayref).
    $main::rownum contains the row number (2 means the first data row). $csv
    is the Text::CSV_XS object. $main::field_idxs is also available for
    additional information.

    If "-e" is not supplied, the new fields will be getting the default
    value of empty string ('').

    *Common notes for the utilities*

    Encoding: The utilities in this module/distribution accept and emit UTF8
    text.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   after => *str*

        Put the new field after specified field.

    *   at => *int*

        Put the new field at specific position (1 means first field).

    *   before => *str*

        Put the new field before specified field.

    *   escape_char => *str*

        Specify character to escape value in field in input CSV, will be
        passed to Text::CSV_XS.

        Defaults to "\\" (backslash). Overrides "--tsv" option.

    *   eval => *str|code*

        Perl code.

    *   fields* => *array[str]*

        Field names.

    *   filename* => *filename*

        Input CSV file or URL.

        Use "-" to read from stdin, use "clipboard:" to read from clipboard.

        Provide row in $_ as hashref instead of arrayref.

    *   header => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether input CSV has a header row.

        By default ("--header"), the first row of the CSV will be assumed to
        contain field names (and the second row contains the first data
        row). When you declare that CSV does not have header row
        ("--no-header"), the first row of the CSV is assumed to contain the
        first data row. Fields will be named "field1", "field2", and so on.

        Whether output CSV should have a header row.

        By default, a header row will be output *if* input CSV has header
        row. Under "--output-header", a header row will be output even if
        input CSV does not have header row (value will be something like
        "col0,col1,..."). Under "--no-output-header", header row will *not*
        be printed even if input CSV has header row. So this option can be
        used to unconditionally add or remove header row.

    *   output_quote_char => *str*

        Specify field quote character in output CSV, will be passed to
        Text::CSV_XS.

        This is like "--quote-char" option but for output instead of input.

        This is like "--tsv" option but for output instead of input.

        Overriden by "--output-sep-char", "--output-quote-char",
        "--output-escape-char" options. If one of those options is
        specified, then "--output-tsv" will be ignored.

    *   overwrite => *bool*

        Whether to override existing output file.

    *   quote_char => *str*

        Specify field quote character in input CSV, will be passed to

  csv_get_cells
    Usage:

     csv_get_cells(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Get one or more cells from CSV.

    This utility lets you specify "coordinates" of cell locations to
    extract. Each coordinate is in the form of "<col>,<row>" where "<col>"
    is the column name or position (zero-based, so 0 is the first column)
    and "<row>" is the row position (one-based, so 1 is the header row and 2
    is the first data row).

        Input CSV file or URL.

        Use "-" to read from stdin, use "clipboard:" to read from clipboard.

    *   header => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether input CSV has a header row.

        By default ("--header"), the first row of the CSV will be assumed to
        contain field names (and the second row contains the first data
        row). When you declare that CSV does not have header row
        ("--no-header"), the first row of the CSV is assumed to contain the
        first data row. Fields will be named "field1", "field2", and so on.

    *   quote_char => *str*

        Specify field quote character in input CSV, will be passed to

  csv_grep
    Usage:

     csv_grep(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Only output row(s) where Perl expression returns true.

    Examples:

    *   Only show rows where the amount field is divisible by 7:

         csv_grep(filename => "file.csv", eval => "\$_->{amount} % 7 ? 1:0", hash => 1);

    *   Only show rows where date is a Wednesday:

         csv_grep(
             filename => "file.csv",
           eval => "BEGIN { use DateTime::Format::Natural; \$parser = DateTime::Format::Natural->new } \$dt = \$parser->parse_datetime(\$_->{date}); \$dt->day_of_week == 3",
           hash => 1
         );

    This is like Perl's "grep" performed over rows of CSV. In $_, your Perl
    code will find the CSV row as an arrayref (or, if you specify "-H", as a
    hashref). $main::row is also set to the row (always as arrayref).
    $main::rownum contains the row number (2 means the first data row).
    $main::csv is the Text::CSV_XS object. $main::field_idxs is also
    available for additional information.

    Your code is then free to return true or false based on some criteria.
    Only rows where Perl expression returns true will be included in the
    result.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something

  csv_munge_field
    Usage:

     csv_munge_field(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Munge a field in every row of CSV file with Perl code.

    Perl code (-e) will be called for each row (excluding the header row)
    and $_ will contain the value of the field, and the Perl code is
    expected to modify it. $main::row will contain the current row array.
    $main::rownum contains the row number (2 means the first data row).
    $main::csv is the Text::CSV_XS object. $main::field_idxs is also
    available for additional information.

    To munge multiple fields, use csv-munge-row.

    text.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   escape_char => *str*

        Specify character to escape value in field in input CSV, will be
        passed to Text::CSV_XS.

        Use "-" to read from stdin, use "clipboard:" to read from clipboard.

    *   header => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether input CSV has a header row.

        By default ("--header"), the first row of the CSV will be assumed to
        contain field names (and the second row contains the first data
        row). When you declare that CSV does not have header row
        ("--no-header"), the first row of the CSV is assumed to contain the
        first data row. Fields will be named "field1", "field2", and so on.

        row. Under "--output-header", a header row will be output even if
        input CSV does not have header row (value will be something like
        "col0,col1,..."). Under "--no-output-header", header row will *not*
        be printed even if input CSV has header row. So this option can be
        used to unconditionally add or remove header row.

    *   output_quote_char => *str*

        Specify field quote character in output CSV, will be passed to
        Text::CSV_XS.

  csv_munge_row
    Usage:

     csv_munge_row(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Munge each data arow of CSV file with Perl code.

    Perl code (-e) will be called for each row (excluding the header row)
    and $_ will contain the row (arrayref, or hashref if "-H" is specified).
    The Perl code is expected to modify it.

    Aside from $_, $main::row will contain the current row array.
    $main::rownum contains the row number (2 means the first data row).
    $main::csv is the Text::CSV_XS object. $main::field_idxs is also
    available for additional information.

    The modified $_ will be rendered back to CSV row.

    You can also munge a single field using csv-munge-field.

    You cannot add new fields using this utility. To do so, use
    csv-add-fields.

  csv_setop
    Usage:

     csv_setop(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Set operation (union/unique concatenation of rows, intersection/common
    rows, difference of rows) against several CSV files.

    Example input:

     # file1.csv
     a,b,c
     1,2,3
     4,5,6
     7,8,9
 
     # file2.csv
     a,b,c
     1,2,3
     4,5,7
     7,8,9

    Output of intersection ("--intersect file1.csv file2.csv"), which will
    return common rows between the two files:

     a,b,c
     1,2,3
     7,8,9

    Output of union ("--union file1.csv file2.csv"), which will return all
    rows with duplicate removed:

     a,b,c
     1,2,3
     4,5,6
     4,5,7
     7,8,9

    Output of difference ("--diff file1.csv file2.csv"), which will return
    all rows in the first file but not in the second:

     a,b,c
     4,5,6

    Output of symmetric difference ("--symdiff file1.csv file2.csv"), which
    will return all rows in the first file not in the second, as well as
    rows in the second not in the first:

     a,b,c
     4,5,6
     4,5,7

    You can specify "--compare-fields" to only consider some fields only,
    for example "--union --compare-fields a,b file1.csv file2.csv":

     a,b,c
     1,2,3
     4,5,6
     7,8,9

    Each field specified in "--compare-fields" can be specified using
    "F1:OTHER1,F2:OTHER2,..." format to refer to different field names or
    indexes in each file, for example if "file3.csv" is:

     # file3.csv
     Ei,Si,Bi
     1,3,2
     4,7,5
     7,9,8

    Then "--union --compare-fields a:Ei,b:Bi file1.csv file3.csv" will
    result in:

     a,b,c
     1,2,3
     4,5,6
     7,8,9

    Finally you can print out certain fields using "--result-fields".

        If one of those options is specified, then "--tsv" will be ignored.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  csv_shuf_rows
    Usage:

     csv_shuf_rows(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Shuffle CSV rows.

    This is basically like Unix command "shuf" except it does not shuffle
    the header row.

    *   header => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether input CSV has a header row.

        By default ("--header"), the first row of the CSV will be assumed to
        contain field names (and the second row contains the first data
        row). When you declare that CSV does not have header row
        ("--no-header"), the first row of the CSV is assumed to contain the
        first data row. Fields will be named "field1", "field2", and so on.

        input CSV does not have header row (value will be something like
        "col0,col1,..."). Under "--no-output-header", header row will *not*
        be printed even if input CSV has header row. So this option can be
        used to unconditionally add or remove header row.

  csv_sort_fields
    Usage:

     csv_sort_fields(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Sort CSV fields.

    This utility sorts the order of fields in the CSV. Example input CSV:

     b,c,a
     1,2,3
     4,5,6

    Example output CSV:

     a,b,c
     3,1,2
     6,4,5

    You can also reverse the sort order ("-r"), sort case-insensitively
    ("-i"), or provides the ordering example, e.g. "--by-examples-json
    '["a","c","b"]'", or use "--by-code" or "--by-sortsub".

    *   by_sortsub => *str*

        Sort using a Sort::Sub routine.

        When sorting rows, usually combined with "--key" because most
        Sort::Sub routine expects a string to be compared against.

        When sorting fields, the Sort::Sub routine will get the field name
        as argument.

    *   ci => *bool*

  csv_sort_rows
    Usage:

     csv_sort_rows(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Sort CSV rows.

    This utility sorts the rows in the CSV. Example input CSV:

     name,age
     Andy,20
     Dennis,15
     Ben,30
     Jerry,30

    Example output CSV (using "--by-field +age" which means by age
    numerically and ascending):

     name,age
     Dennis,15
     Andy,20
     Ben,30
     Jerry,30

    Example output CSV (using "--by-field -age", which means by age
    numerically and descending):

     name,age
     Ben,30
     Jerry,30
     Andy,20
     Dennis,15

    Example output CSV (using "--by-field name", which means by name
    ascibetically and ascending):

     name,age
     Andy,20
     Ben,30
     Dennis,15
     Jerry,30

    Example output CSV (using "--by-field ~name", which means by name
    ascibetically and descending):

     name,age
     Jerry,30
     Dennis,15
     Ben,30
     Andy,20

    Example output CSV (using "--by-field +age --by-field ~name"):

     name,age
     Dennis,15
     Andy,20
     Jerry,30
     Ben,30

    You can also reverse the sort order ("-r") or sort case-insensitively
    ("-i").

    For more flexibility, instead of "--by-field" you can use "--by-code":

    Example output "--by-code '$a->[1] <=> $b->[1] || $b->[0] cmp $a->[0]'"
    (which is equivalent to "--by-field +age --by-field ~name"):

     name,age
     Dennis,15
     Andy,20
     Jerry,30
     Ben,30

    If you use "--hash", your code will receive the rows to be compared as
    hashref, e.g. `--hash --by-code '$a->{age} <=> $b->{age} || $b->{name}
    cmp $a->{name}'.

    A third alternative is to sort using Sort::Sub routines. Example output
    (using "--by-sortsub 'by_length<r>' --key '$_->[0]'", which is to say to
    sort by descending length of name):

     name,age
     Dennis,15
     Jerry,30
     Andy,20
     Ben,30

        Generate sort keys with this Perl code.

        If specified, then will compute sort keys using Perl code and sort
        using the keys. Relevant when sorting using "--by-code" or
        "--by-sortsub". If specified, then instead of row when sorting rows,

        Defaults to "," (comma). Overrides "--output-tsv" option.

    *   output_tsv => *bool*

        Inform that output file is TSV (tab-separated) format instead of
        CSV.

        This is like "--tsv" option but for output instead of input.

        Overriden by "--output-sep-char", "--output-quote-char",
        "--output-escape-char" options. If one of those options is
        specified, then "--output-tsv" will be ignored.

    *   quote_char => *str*

        Specify field quote character in input CSV, will be passed to
        Text::CSV_XS.

        Defaults to """ (double quote). Overrides "--tsv" option.

    *   sep_char => *str*

        Specify field separator character in input CSV, will be passed to
        Text::CSV_XS.

        If one of those options is specified, then "--tsv" will be ignored.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  csv_sum
    Usage:

     csv_sum(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

    Output a summary row which are arithmetic sums of data rows.

    *Common notes for the utilities*

    Encoding: The utilities in this module/distribution accept and emit UTF8
    text.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   escape_char => *str*

        Specify character to escape value in field in input CSV, will be
        passed to Text::CSV_XS.

        Defaults to "\\" (backslash). Overrides "--tsv" option.

    *   filename* => *filename*

        Input CSV file or URL.

        Use "-" to read from stdin, use "clipboard:" to read from clipboard.

    *   header => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether input CSV has a header row.

        By default ("--header"), the first row of the CSV will be assumed to
        contain field names (and the second row contains the first data
        row). When you declare that CSV does not have header row
        ("--no-header"), the first row of the CSV is assumed to contain the
        first data row. Fields will be named "field1", "field2", and so on.

    *   output_escape_char => *str*

        Specify character to escape value in field in output CSV, will be
        passed to Text::CSV_XS.

        Defaults to "\\" (backslash). Overrides "--output-tsv" option.

    *   output_filename => *filename*

        Output filename or URL.

    *   output_header => *bool*

        Whether output CSV should have a header row.

        By default, a header row will be output *if* input CSV has header
        row. Under "--output-header", a header row will be output even if
        input CSV does not have header row (value will be something like
        "col0,col1,..."). Under "--no-output-header", header row will *not*
        be printed even if input CSV has header row. So this option can be
        used to unconditionally add or remove header row.

    *   output_quote_char => *str*

        Specify field quote character in output CSV, will be passed to
        Text::CSV_XS.

        This is like "--quote-char" option but for output instead of input.

        Defaults to """ (double quote). Overrides "--output-tsv" option.

    *   output_sep_char => *str*

        Specify field separator character in output CSV, will be passed to

        Inform that output file is TSV (tab-separated) format instead of
        CSV.

        This is like "--tsv" option but for output instead of input.

        Overriden by "--output-sep-char", "--output-quote-char",
        "--output-escape-char" options. If one of those options is
        specified, then "--output-tsv" will be ignored.

    *   overwrite => *bool*

        Whether to override existing output file.

    *   quote_char => *str*

        Specify field quote character in input CSV, will be passed to
        Text::CSV_XS.

        Defaults to """ (double quote). Overrides "--tsv" option.

    *   sep_char => *str*

        Specify field separator character in input CSV, will be passed to
        Text::CSV_XS.

        Defaults to "," (comma). Overrides "--tsv" option.

    *   tsv => *bool*

        Inform that input file is in TSV (tab-separated) format instead of
        CSV.

        Overriden by "--sep-char", "--quote-char", "--escape-char" options.
        If one of those options is specified, then "--tsv" will be ignored.

    *   with_data_rows => *bool*

        Whether to also output data rows.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element ($status_code) is an integer containing HTTP-like status
    code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second
    element ($reason) is a string containing error message, or something
    like "OK" if status is 200. Third element ($payload) is the actual
    result, but usually not present when enveloped result is an error
    response ($status_code is not 2xx). Fourth element (%result_meta) is
    called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information, much like how HTTP response headers provide additional
    metadata.

    Return value: (any)

  csv_transpose
    Usage:

     csv_transpose(%args) -> [$status_code, $reason, $payload, \%result_meta]

FAQ
  My CSV does not have a header?
    Use the "--no-header" option. Fields will be named "field1", "field2",
    and so on.

  My data is TSV, not CSV?
    Use the "--tsv" option.

  I have a big CSV and the utilities are too slow or eat too much RAM!
    These utilities are not (yet) optimized, patches welcome. If your CSV is
    very big, perhaps a C-based solution is what you need.

CONTRIBUTING
    To contribute, you can send patches by email/via RT, or send pull
    requests on GitHub.

    Most of the time, you don't need to build the distribution yourself. You
    can simply modify the code, then test via:

     % prove -l

    If you want to build the distribution (e.g. to try to install it locally
    on your system), you can install Dist::Zilla,
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR,
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR, and sometimes one or two
    other Dist::Zilla- and/or Pod::Weaver plugins. Any additional steps
    required beyond that are considered a bug and can be reported to me.
